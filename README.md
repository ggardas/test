Re: Notice of Intent to Vacate\
\
Dear \[Landlord\'s name\],\
\
As per my rental agreement, I am providing this letter as a \[\#\#\]-day
notice that I will be moving out of my rental unit on \[date\]. This day
marks the end of my lease that began on \[date\]. This letter shall
serve as my written notice of intent to vacate the premises.\
\
\[In case you are breaking the lease because there are issues with the
apartment, state them here\]\
\
Please contact me at \[phone number\] in order to schedule a
walk-through inspection. I expect my security deposit of \[\$ amount\]
to be refunded in full as my apartment is being left in good condition.
Please send my deposit to my forwarding address: \[new address\].\
\
If any other issues or questions arise after I move, I can be reached at
\[phone number\] or \[email\].\
\
Sincerely,\
\
\[Your Name\]
